# CircoTax
An R function for that exploits the radial capabilities of ggplot2 for the representation of differential abundance analyses on microbiota data.
The plot can be obtained both using a data frame (see CircoTax_input_example.txt) or receiving data directly from the two R funtions
- CircoTax_DESeq2.R
- CircoTax_ALDEx2.R

that perform the differential abundance analysis (with two differnt methods) and then plots the CircoTax plot.

Please read the file CircoTax_tutorial.pdf for a guide on how to use the package.
