# CircoTax
CircoTax is an R function for that exploits the radial capabilities of ggplot2 for the representation of differential abundance analyses on microbiota data.
The function can loaad data both from a data.frame (see CircoTax_input_example.txt) or can receive data directly from the two R funtions
- CircoTax_DESeq2.R
- CircoTax_ALDEx2.R

They both perform a differential abundance analysis (with two differnt R packages, namely DESeq2 and ALDEx2) and then automatically plot the CircoTax plot.

Please read the file CircoTax_tutorial.pdf for a guide on how to use the package.
